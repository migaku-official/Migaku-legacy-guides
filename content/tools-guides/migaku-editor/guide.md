## Main Features

### In-Place Editing

In-Place Editing is a feature that allows you to edit the contents of your cards while you study them. That means you can quickly fix a mistake on a new card you're studying, or change the format of a card while you're reviewing it!

#### How to In-Place Edit

<!--In-Place Editing a Field-->

<migaku-video controls src="/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-editor/in-place-editing-field.mp4"></migaku-video>

In-Place Editing is very easy to begin, simply:

1. Start studying a new card or reviewing a card.
1. Double click the field you would like to edit.
   - A rectangular box with a blue border will then appear around your field signifying that In-Place Editing has been enabled.
1. Make any changes you would like.
   - Note that formatting hotkeys such as "Ctrl+B" to bold text, or "Ctrl+I" to italicize text also function when making in-place edits.
1. Click outside of the field that you're editing to finish editing that field.

<!--In-Place Editing Pasting in Images and Audio-->

<migaku-video controls src="/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-editor/in-place-editing-images-audio.mp4"></migaku-video>

You can even paste images and audio files directly into a field while using In-Place Editing.

**Please note that In-Place Editing does not function while [the Persistent Editor](#the-persistent-editor) is open. This is by design and in order to avoid conflicts while editing.**

##### Integrated with Other Migaku Add-ons

<!--Using Migaku Japanese Hotkeys In-Place-->

<migaku-video controls src="/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-editor/in-place-japanese-hotkeys.mp4"></migaku-video>

If you are using one of our other add-ons that add special support when learning a certain language, such as the <internal-link to="/tools-guides/migaku-japanese/guide">Migaku Japanese Add-on</internal-link>, then you can use the hotkeys added by those add-ons while using In-Place Editing.

#### Hiding Empty Fields

By default empty fields are shown as a rectangle with a light red border:
![Empty Field Box](/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-editor/empty-field-box.png)

This is in order to give the user an area to double click in to begin In-Place Editing that empty field, without doing this the field would be invisible and not able to be selected for In-Place Editing. If you would like to hide Empty Fields on your cards you can do this by navigating to `Migaku->Hide Empty Fields` in Anki's top menu bar. _(You can re-enable this feature at any time by navigating to `Migaku->Show Empty Fields`.)_

<!--Hide and Show Empty Fields-->

<migaku-video controls src="/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-editor/hide-show-empty-fields.mp4"></migaku-video>

#### Enabling or Disabling In-Place Editing

<!--Enabling and Disabling In-Place Editing-->

<migaku-video controls src="/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-editor/enable-disable-in-place-editing.mp4"></migaku-video>

You can Enable or Disable In-Place Editing at any time by navigating to `Migaku->Enable In-Place Editing` or `Migaku->Disable In-Place Editing` respectively in Anki's top menu bar.

### The Persistent Editor

When you are using the Migaku Editor Add-on while studying your Anki Cards and click the "Edit" button at the bottom left of the screen, you will notice that the "Migaku Editor" window has replaced the default Anki card editing window. This "Migaku Editor" window is actually a persistent window that can remain open while you study your cards.

<!--Editing and Reviewing Cards With Persistent Editor Open-->

<migaku-video controls src="/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-editor/editing-reviewing-persistent.mp4"></migaku-video>

This Persistent Editor window has the following behavior:

1. The window will remain open until it is closed by the user.
1. Any changes made to a card's contents will be reflected on Anki's review screen.
1. As you study different cards their contents will automatically be loaded into the persistent editor, always staying in-sync with the card that is being shown on Anki's review screen.
1. The contents of a card will be hidden in the persistent editor when Anki's review screen is on the <internal-link to="/tools-guides/">Front of the Card</internal-link>.
   - This is in order to not potentially give away the answer.
   - You can click on the persistent editor to display the card's contents even while Anki's review screen is on the <internal-link to="/tools-guides/anki/guide#the-front-(question)-side-of-a-card">Front of the Card</internal-link>.
1. All regular Anki editing functionality is available.

**Please note that [In-Place Editing](#in-place-editing) does not function while the Persistent Editor is open. This is by design and in order to avoid conflicts while editing.**

### Resizing Images

Another quality of life improvement added by Migaku Editor is the ability to resize images while editing cards. This functions both with [In-Place Editing](#in-place-editing), in [the Persistent Editor](#the-persistent-editor), and even in Anki's Card Browser.

<!--Resizing Images In-Place and in the Persistent Editor-->

<migaku-video controls src="/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-editor/resizing-images.mp4"></migaku-video>

To edit the size of an image:

1. Start editing a card with [In-Place Editing](#in-place-editing), in [the Persistent Editor](#the-persistent-editor), or in Anki's Card Browser.
1. Then you can:
   - "Click+Drag" an image to the left and right to resize it while respecting its aspect ratio.
   - "Ctrl+Click+Drag" an image to resize it freely.
   - "Shift+Click" an image to restore an image's original dimensions.

<!--Hovering an Image-->

<migaku-video controls src="/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-editor/hovering-an-image.mp4"></migaku-video>

_You can hover over an image to view the editing instructions at any time._
