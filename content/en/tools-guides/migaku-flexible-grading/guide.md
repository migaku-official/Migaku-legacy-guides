Migaku Flexible Grading is a simple quality-of-life add-on that seeks to improve the efficiency of flashcard study in Anki.

It does this by adding the following features to Anki:

1. The option to simplify Anki's 4 button grading system down in a 2 button "Pass/Fail" system.
1. The ability to answer cards on their <internal-link to="/tools-guides/anki/guide#the-front-(question)-side-of-a-card">Front Side</internal-link>.

### Pass/Fail Answering Mode

Once you have enabled Pass/Fail Answering Mode you will see that Anki's default buttons have been replaced by a "Fail" and a "Pass" button.

<!--Answering Cards with Pass Fail-->

<migaku-video controls src="/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-flexible-grading/answering-cards-with-pass-fail.mp4"></migaku-video>

**To find out more about why we recommend using Pass/Fail Answering Mode please read <internal-link to="/tools-guides/anki/guide/#anki's-algorithm">this section of our Anki Guide</internal-link>.**

### Answering on the Front of the Card

We at Migaku feel that a learner will often know that they simply "know" a card a lot of the time, and often times not really look at the <internal-link to="/tools-guides/anki/guide#the-back-(answer)-side-of-a-card">Back of the Card</internal-link> while reviewing. In order to speed up the reviews of the well-known cards Migaku Flexible Grading adds the ability to answer cards from their <internal-link to="/tools-guides/anki/guide#the-front-(question)-side-of-a-card">Front Side</internal-link>.

<!--Answering Cards From the Front-->

<migaku-video controls src="/content-images/tools-guides/migaku-flexible-grading/answering-cards-from-front.mp4"></migaku-video>

You can do this by:

1. Clicking the answering buttons that are added to the front of cards by the add-on.
1. Pressing the hotkeys `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`.
